***GENETICS AND GENOMICS FOR NURSING***brings together the genetics and genomics knowledge nurses need to provide safe and effective care in today’s “genomic era.” It teaches through small, modular units, each with pretests, section quizzes, and post-tests. Answers are provided to help students check their knowledge, and Emerging Evidence and Critical Thinking checkpoints encourage them to apply it. The text first places modern genetics in context, introduces its essential principles, and outlines its deep ethical, legal, social, and public policy implications. Next, readers learn how to take family genetic histories and assess risks; utilize immunogenetics and cancer genetics in cancer prevention and treatment; apply genetics in public health promotion; recognize the role of genes in psychiatric illnesses and in aging; and much more.
